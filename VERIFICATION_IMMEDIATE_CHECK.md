# Immediate Verification Check - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Previously, verification was only checked on write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). This meant users with expired verification could browse the site indefinitely without knowing they needed to reverify until they tried to interact (post, comment, like, etc.).

## Solution
Verification status is now checked on **EVERY authenticated request**, and the verification modal appears **immediately** when the user makes their first request (even just loading a page).

## How It Works

### 1. Backend Middleware (`accounts/middleware.py`)

**On every authenticated request:**
```python
# Check verification status for ALL authenticated requests
profile.sync_verification_status()

if not profile.is_verified:
    # Store flag for response processing
    request._verification_expired = True

    # Block write operations immediately
    if request.method in ['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE']:
        return JsonResponse({...}, status=403)
```

**In response processing:**
```python
# Add headers for read operations with expired verification
if hasattr(request, '_verification_expired') and request._verification_expired:
    response['X-Verification-Required'] = 'true'
    response['X-Verification-Message'] = 'Your account verification has expired...'
```

### 2. Frontend API Interceptor (`src/services/apiService.js`)

**Success response handler:**
```javascript
(response) => {
  // Check EVERY response for verification header
  const verificationRequired = response.headers['x-verification-required'];

  if (verificationRequired === 'true') {
    // Trigger verification modal
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('verificationRequired', {...}));
  }

  return response;
}
```

**Error response handler** (for write operations):
```javascript
if (error.response?.status === 403 && errorData.error_code === 'VERIFICATION_EXPIRED') {
  // Trigger verification modal
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('verificationRequired', {...}));
}
```

### 3. AuthContext Modal Management (`src/contexts/AuthContext.js`)

**State tracking:**
```javascript
const [showVerificationModal, setShowVerificationModal] = useState(false);
const [verificationModalShown, setVerificationModalShown] = useState(false);
```

**Event listener:**
```javascript
const handleVerificationRequired = (event) => {
  // Only show modal once per session until verified
  if (verificationModalShown) return;

  setShowVerificationModal(true);
  setVerificationModalShown(true);
};
```

**Reset after successful verification:**
```javascript
const resetVerificationModal = useCallback(() => {
  setVerificationModalShown(false);  // Allow modal to show again
  setShowVerificationModal(false);
}, []);
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User logs in or has active session** (Remember Me feature)
2. **First request is made** (e.g., loading dashboard, browsing feed)
3. **Middleware checks verification** on that request
4. **If expired:**
   - Read requests: Add `X-Verification-Required` header, allow request to proceed
   - Write requests: Return 403 error immediately
5. **Frontend interceptor detects** verification requirement
6. **Modal appears immediately** over current page
7. **User can still browse** while modal is visible
8. **User enters verification code**
9. **On success:**
   - Modal closes
   - `verificationModalShown` flag resets
   - User data refreshed
   - Full access restored

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate awareness**: User knows they need to verify as soon as they open the site
✅ **No surprises**: No failed interactions due to unknown expired verification
✅ **Non-blocking for reads**: Can still browse content while modal is shown
✅ **Blocks writes**: Cannot post/comment/interact until verified
✅ **Shows once**: Modal doesn't repeatedly appear on every request
✅ **Resets properly**: Flag resets after successful verification
✅ **No polling**: Uses natural request flow for checking
✅ **Efficient**: Minimal overhead, uses existing middleware

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Expired Verification on Login
```python
# In Django shell
from accounts.models import UserProfile
from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import timedelta

profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user__username='elvist')
profile.last_verified_at = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=8)
profile.save()
```

1. Log in with the user
2. Modal should appear immediately on first page load
3. User can browse but cannot post/comment
4. Complete verification → modal closes

### Test Scenario 2: Active Session Recovery
1. User logs in with "Remember Me" checked
2. Close browser
3. Expire verification in backend
4. Reopen browser and visit site
5. Session recovers automatically
6. First request triggers modal immediately

### Test Scenario 3: Modal Shows Only Once
1. Trigger expired verification
2. Load multiple pages
3. Modal should appear on first request only
4. Does not reappear until closed and verification expires again

## Code Changes Summary

**Backend:**
- `accounts/middleware.py`: Check verification on ALL requests, add response headers

**Frontend:**
- `src/services/apiService.js`: Check response headers on ALL responses
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`: Add `verificationModalShown` flag and `resetVerificationModal` function
- `src/App.js`: Call `resetVerificationModal` on successful verification

**Documentation:**
- `VERIFICATION_FLOW.md`: Updated to reflect immediate checking behavior
- `VERIFICATION_IMMEDIATE_CHECK.md`: This file - implementation summary
