## Authentication Considerations
- Requests require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Replace token when `X-Renewed-Access` header exists
- Access token expiration (5 minutes) will not interrupt active users because of auto-renew while session valid

## How Recommendations Work
The content recommendation system provides personalized content to users using a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, trending analysis, and hybrid algorithms. The system is designed to maximize user engagement and relevance.

### Recommendation Algorithms
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests content based on the behavior and preferences of similar users (e.g., likes, shares, comments).
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends content similar to what the user has interacted with, using hashtags, content type, and metadata.
- **Trending/Popular Content:** Highlights posts that are trending globally or within a user's communities.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines multiple algorithms to balance personalization and discovery.

### Data Flow
1. **User Activity Tracking:** All user interactions (views, likes, comments, shares, etc.) are tracked and stored.
2. **Preference Modeling:** User preferences are updated based on recent activity (hashtags, content types, communities, etc.).
3. **Recommendation Generation:**
    - Periodic background tasks generate and update recommendations for each user.
    - Recommendations are stored in the `ContentRecommendation` model, with a score and reason for each item.
4. **Serving Recommendations:**
    - The `/api/recommendations/` endpoint provides the current recommendations for a user, ordered by score.
    - Recommendations can be filtered by type (e.g., trending, similar users, hashtag-based).
5. **Feedback Loop:**
    - User feedback (like, dislike, not interested, etc.) is collected via the `RecommendationFeedback` model.
    - Feedback is used to refine future recommendations and improve algorithm accuracy.

### Example Recommendation Object
```json
{
  "user": "<user_id>",
  "content_type": "post",
  "object_id": "<post_id>",
  "score": 0.92,
  "recommendation_type": "hybrid",
  "reason": "Similar to posts you've liked and trending in your community.",
  "algorithm_version": "v1.0",
  "metadata": {"hashtags": ["#ai", "#news"]},
  "is_viewed": false,
  "is_clicked": false
}
```

### Improving Recommendations
- The system continuously learns from user actions and feedback.
- A/B testing is used to compare different algorithms and optimize engagement.
- Admins can manually trigger recommendation updates or adjust algorithm parameters.

---

## Signals & Automation
Signals are used to update engagement metrics, trigger notifications, and enforce moderation rules on content creation, update, and deletion.
Automated moderation and bot detection are triggered via signals and background tasks.
Content recommendation and A/B testing assignments are updated via signals on user/content activity.

## Background Tasks
- **Moderation:**
    - Auto-moderation of content using ML and rule-based systems.
    - Cleanup of expired moderation queue items and auto-moderation actions.
- **Bot Detection:**
    - Periodic analysis of user activity for bot detection.
    - Cleanup of old bot detection events.
- **Recommendation System:**
    - Generation of personalized content recommendations for users.
    - Calculation of content similarity scores.
    - Update of user content preferences based on recent activity.
- **A/B Testing:**
    - Assignment of users to experiments and groups.
    - Aggregation and analysis of experiment metrics/results.

## Test Documentation
### Test Files
- `tests.py`, `test_dislike.py`, `test.py` ‚Äî Main and feature-specific test suites for the content app

### Running Tests
```sh
python manage.py test content
```

### Test Coverage
- CRUD operations for all main models (Post, Comment, Like, Dislike, Share, Media, etc.)
- Moderation and bot detection logic
- Recommendation and A/B testing workflows
- Signals and background task triggers

---


## Background Tasks (Celery)
The content app uses Celery for background processing of moderation, bot detection, recommendations, and A/B testing. Tasks are scheduled via **django-celery-beat** (database-driven scheduling) and can be managed through Django Admin at `/admin/django_celery_beat/`.
