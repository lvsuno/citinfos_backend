# Verification Modal Not Showing - Fix Summary

## Problem
User elvist had expired verification (>7 days), but the verification modal was not appearing when refreshing the page, even though the middleware was correctly checking verification status and setting headers.

## Root Cause
The custom verification headers (`X-Verification-Required` and `X-Verification-Message`) were being set by the middleware but were **NOT exposed in the CORS configuration**, so the frontend JavaScript couldn't read them.

## Solution
Added the verification headers to `CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS` in `settings.py`:

```python
CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS = [
    'x-new-access-token',
    'x-new-refresh-token',
    'x-session-id',
    'x-device-fingerprint',
    'x-verification-required',     # ✅ ADDED
    'x-verification-message',      # ✅ ADDED
]
```

## Technical Explanation

### CORS and Custom Headers
By default, JavaScript can only read a limited set of "simple" response headers:
- Cache-Control
- Content-Language
- Content-Type
- Expires
- Last-Modified
- Pragma

**Custom headers** (like `X-Verification-Required`) must be explicitly listed in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` (configured via Django's `CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS` setting) for the browser to allow JavaScript to read them.

### The Flow
1. ✅ Backend middleware sets headers correctly
2. ✅ Headers are sent in HTTP response
3. ❌ Browser blocks JavaScript from reading custom headers (CORS policy)
4. ❌ Frontend interceptor can't detect `response.headers['x-verification-required']`
5. ❌ Modal never appears

### After Fix
1. ✅ Backend middleware sets headers correctly
2. ✅ Headers are sent with `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
3. ✅ Browser allows JavaScript to read custom headers
4. ✅ Frontend interceptor detects `response.headers['x-verification-required']`
5. ✅ Modal appears immediately!

## Debug Logging Added

### Backend (`accounts/middleware.py`)
```python
# In process_request
logger.warning(
    f"Verification expired for user {request.user.username} - "
    f"Method: {request.method}, Path: {request.path}"
)

# In process_response
logger.warning(
    f"Adding verification headers to response - "
    f"Path: {request.path}, Status: {response.status_code}"
)
```

### Frontend (`src/services/apiService.js`)
```javascript
// In response interceptor
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('🔍 API Response Headers:', {
    'x-verification-required': verificationRequired,
    'x-verification-message': verificationMessage,
    url: response.config?.url,
    method: response.config?.method
  });
}

if (verificationRequired === 'true') {
  console.log('🚨 Verification Required - Dispatching event');
  // ...
}
```

### Frontend (`src/contexts/AuthContext.js`)
```javascript
const handleVerificationRequired = (event) => {
    console.log('🔔 Verification Required Event Received:', event.detail);
    console.log('   verificationModalShown:', verificationModalShown);
    // ...
}
```

## Testing

1. **Verify elvist's verification is expired:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T backend python manage.py shell << 'EOF'
   from accounts.models import UserProfile
   profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user__username='elvist')
   print(f'Is verified: {profile.is_verified}')
   EOF
   ```

2. **Log in to frontend** as elvist

3. **Check browser console** for debug logs:
   - Should see: `🔍 API Response Headers:` with `x-verification-required: true`
   - Should see: `🚨 Verification Required - Dispatching event`
   - Should see: `🔔 Verification Required Event Received:`
   - Modal should appear immediately

4. **Check backend logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend | grep -i verification
   ```
   - Should see: `WARNING Verification expired for user elvist`
   - Should see: `WARNING Adding verification headers to response`

## Files Modified

1. **citinfos_backend/settings.py**
   - Added `'x-verification-required'` and `'x-verification-message'` to `CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS`

2. **accounts/middleware.py**
   - Added debug logging for verification checks

3. **src/services/apiService.js**
   - Added debug logging for header detection

4. **src/contexts/AuthContext.js**
   - Added debug logging for event handling

## Lesson Learned
When adding custom response headers in a CORS environment (frontend on different port/domain), **always remember to expose them** in the CORS configuration. Headers are useless if JavaScript can't read them!

## Next Steps
Once verified working, the debug logging can be removed or kept for production debugging.
